## üßê &nbsp; Why

[Render Props](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) are the new hype of React's ecossystem, that's a fact. So, when you need to use more than one render props component together, this can be borring and generate something like a *"render hell"*.

## üí° &nbsp; Solution

React Adopt it's just a simple method that you can compose your components and return all props in a function by mapping each child prop returned by your component.

## üíª &nbsp; Usage ([demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/vq1wl37m0y?hidenavigation=1))

Install as project dependency:

```bash
$ yarn add react-adopt
```

Then you can use the method to compose your components

```js
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { adopt } from 'react-adopt'

import { Filter } from './my-awesome-filter-component'

const Composed = adopt({
  kids: <Filter list={people} by={p => p.age < 18} />,
  adults: <Filter list={people} by={p => p.age >= 18} />
})

const App = () => (
  <Composed>
    {({ kids, adults }) => (
      <div>
        <ul>{kids.map(p => <li>{p.name}</li>)}</ul>
        <ul>{adults.map(p => <li>{p.name}</li>)}</ul>
      </div>
    )}
  </Composed>
)
```
